A collection of Bash libraries
##############################

An each library collects many useful functions for simplifying a development in Bash.
Instead of copy-pasting the same functions from one script to another it's much better to include once an external library and reuse the same code everywhere.

Installation

The installation is as easy as

1. Download the latest version of the library from this collection
